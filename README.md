# Demo Scripts and Templates

This repo contains various code snippets and ARM templates used in a Rackspace-devised "Automation in Azure" workshop

To run them, you will need to:

* Ensure you have the pre-requisites installed on your machine (see `prereqs.ps1`)
* Set up a Service Principal (with `Owner`-level permissions)
* Copy `vars-sample.ps1` to a file named `vars.ps1` in the same directory
* Edit `vars.ps1` with the appropriate values

Note that each directory contains a file named `demo.ps1`. This file is not intended to be run directly.
